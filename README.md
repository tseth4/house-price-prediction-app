# Home Price Prediction Web App

## Overview
This project is a full-stack web application that predicts home prices based on user inputs. The application leverages a machine learning model to provide accurate predictions and is designed with a user-friendly interface. It showcases skills in data science, machine learning, full-stack development, and cloud deployment.

## Features
- Predicts home prices using a Random Forest regression model trained on a dataset of 2,000,000 rows.
- User-friendly interface built with React and TypeScript for seamless interaction.
- Back-end API developed with Flask for data processing and prediction.
- Deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with CloudFront integration for secure and efficient delivery.

## Technologies Used
